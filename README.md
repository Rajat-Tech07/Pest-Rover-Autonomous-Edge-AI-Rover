Pest Rover — Autonomous Edge AI Rover

-- Overview
    PestiRover is an Autonomous Edge AI–powered agricultural rover designed for precision pesticide spraying.  
    It diagnoses plant disease using AI (CNN models) and applies variable-rate chemical dosing with extreme accuracy using a laser-based localization system.

-- Advanced Detection  
    Camera , CNN instantly identifies leaf infections  
    Laser scanner pinpoints exact infected location  
    Generates infection severity score  

-- Accurate Chemical Application  
    PWM-controlled pump/valve  
    Minimal chemical dose based on severity  
    70–90% pesticide reduction  

-- Connectivity & Safety  
    4G/5G logging to cloud dashboard  
    Rain & wind sensors (interlock safety)  
    RTK-GPS for high-precision navigation  

-- Data Generation  
    Logs all spraying events  
    Generates plant health heatmap
